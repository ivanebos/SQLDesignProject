# SQLDesignProject
- Analyzed a given system description to extract and define comprehensive system requirements, demonstrating strong understanding of client needs and translating them into technical specifications.
- Designed and developed Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams that accurately represented the relationships, entities, and attributes of the system, effectively serving as a visual blueprint for the database structure.
- Translated the ER diagrams into a well-structured SQL schema, implementing tables, relationships, primary and foreign keys, and other necessary constraints to reflect the defined system requirements.
- Leveraged PostgreSQL and Postico to populate the database with sample data, facilitating comprehensive testing of the SQL schema's functionality and accuracy.
